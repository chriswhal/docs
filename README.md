# APN Global Compliance Policy & Procedure Repository

Cloud compliance doesn't have to be complicated.  The AWS Partner Network helps relieve your compliance burden with our certified cloud computing platform and solutions for regulated industries.

In an effort to make compliance as easy as possible for AWS technology and consulting partners serving regulated industries, we launched this open-source policy & procedure repository based on AWS's own IT governance model.  The documents have been written with modern cloud practices in mind and they're routinely audited by independent third-parties as part of AWS's world class compliance programs.

## How to use these policies and procedures
As an AWS partner serving regulated customers, you must establish and maintain your own policies and procedures.  To make use of these policies and procedures, do the following:

1. Define your business [operating model](http://) and [agreement model](http://).
2. Review and download the policies and procedures that are applicable to your business.
3. Personalize and approve the policies and procedures in your business.
4. Train or quiz your team on the final, approved policies and procedures.
5. Publish and follow your policies and procedures.
6. Update and improve your policies and procedures regularly, retraining your team as needed.
7. Retain your obsolete policies and procedures, as well as your logs and records, as evidence of your controls.
8. Recall and present your evidence during customer assessments, third-party audits and regulator investigations.
